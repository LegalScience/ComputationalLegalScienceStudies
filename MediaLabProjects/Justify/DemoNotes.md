# Potential Adopters

## KSG 

Tomorrow with a Harvard professor at Kennedy School of Government.
Our meeting will be after this but I'm hoping for at least 1 other meeting of that type
in the near term with a MIT-Harvard prof. of a, I suspect, similar bent.

## And in D.C. Apr 14, 15:

## DOE

Dept Of energy office of Advance Manufacturing.
The kinds of decisions they're interested in supporting are:
- What "areas" should we be funding
- Which specific proposals should we be funding.


## World Bank

Engaging citizen in developing nations in assessing public policy

## Deloitte: 

specifically a team that is funded to write a report for the federal gov
on what the workforce of the government will look like in 2025

## NYU GovLabs, which you know better than I.
 
# Which of Above is Most Likely to Adopt

a) succeed in the sense they could turn into live pilots or even deployments eventually
fry sez: Very tough to say, they are all quite different contexts.
the Harvard guys it might find its way into a class in the fall semester.
DOE and Deloitte are likely very closed working groups will a small number of players,
but they're well focused and may have a better chance just because of that.
The world bank is the lonely one that really wants to open up to "the public at large".
b) they are well suited to open a collaboration because they have the resources and the time and the style of work that is effective and efficient and motivated to get back to you quickly and well and follow up with items, etc, and
fry sez: I've had good communications with DOE and Deloitte so far leading up to the events
so that speaks well to continued collaboration.

# what are the main ways Justify could be used by the stakeholders 

(not necessarily the one's footing the bill or pushing a collaboration, but stakeholder in the sense that they are deeply involved and would have a stake in the process and/or outcome of the process of using Justify) eg business partners of who you are meeting with, or maybe their employees, or if the meeting was with a television production company, maybe the key stakeholders are the audience of their media outlet or maybe their advertisers or maybe the staff of the show, etc  

Fry sez: the project where the "funder" is most different from "the users" is the World Bank
as they want to get a city/province -wide user network. I expect these users will be limited by
simply limited access to the internet, though even in a lot of developing countries this
is surprisingly good now. Highly dependent on the locals they want to deploy in.

Asking: who would care and why as in: what value (time saved, money saved, money made, risk avoided, etc) can be achieved for those stakeholders.    
 
Fry sez: DOE is most focused on this. They are making specific funding decisions.
They don't have much of a formal process right now as I understand it, though I'm
trying to learn more before I get in there. They want to avoid the risk of funding the next

Don't worry if you don't know any of the above, just make it up if you need to.  The other leg of this method is to align the tests or pilots etc to something that also creates research or academic value in addition to business value for the partner - and by asking some important research questions or testing research hypothesis about how the system will be used I think the "yes let's do a project" scenario becomes also a good Media Lab fit - in theory.  Anyway let's use the email thread to prep these questions and I'll show you how to map your demo to answer the "Why do I care and What would I do with this" question, hence setting up a demo that has a great path to Yes and through Yes to a self-sustaining pilot and production path.  That's the best case and it's the one I propose we focus upon as an organizing theme.  It will improve your demo a lot and give you a great method to tune your demo's to other context.  
 
Fry sez: I'm expecting to give quite different presentations to each of the above, though
to be sure there will be commonalties.
